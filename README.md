# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose and Functionality

Site provides the user with a form to search for weather on a city. The user types a city name into the form and submits the form. Upon form submission, an API call is made to a geocoding API to pull the coordinates of the requested city. After pulling the coordinates, they are passed to a function to call a weather API. This API contains data for the current weather, as well as a forecast. The data is then parsed and displayed to the user. The user is presented with the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV Index, and an icon depicting the current weather. The UV Index is color coded based on its value to provide the user with feedback on whether the conditions are favorable or not.

The data is also parsed to provide information on the five day forecast for the selected city. This returns much of the same data as the current weather, with the exception of not returning the UV Index.

The 9 most recent searched cities are saved in local storage so that the user can re-search for those cities without using the form. They are able to simply click the button for the city of interest and the same data will be displayed.

The search history is organized such that the most recent search is always at the top and the rest are listed in descending order. If a city is selected that is already in local storage (either via a new form submission, or a history button click), that city is moved back to the top of the history list.

## Key Learnings

- Server Side APIs
  - Using multiple API calls to return the required data.
  - managing asynchronous nature of API calls, and how to call the next function at the correct time in the program.
- use of CSS framework
  - Use of bootstrap to quickly and efficiently add consistent styling to an application

## Future Improvements

- currently the saved cities run the full set of functions to get the new weather data. This includes two API calls. I saved more information than just the city name in Local Storage, and I believe that through the use of data attributes, all of the data that is generated by the geocoding API can be passed directly to the weather API. This will improve application performance by reducing application load time by cutting out one API call.
